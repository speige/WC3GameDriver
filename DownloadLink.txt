You accidentally clicked "Source Code" under GitHub Releases.
You probably meant to click "WC3GameDriver.zip" to download the compiled binaries

You can download them here:
https://github.com/speige/WC3GameDriver/releases/latest/download/WC3GameDriver.zip


If you actually want to read the source code, Google how to "clone" the repository instead.
